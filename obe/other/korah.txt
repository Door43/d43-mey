====== Korah ======

===== Definition: =====

Korah was the name of at least two men in the Old Testament.

  * One of the sons of Esau was named Korah. He became a leader in his community.
  * Korah was also a descendant of Levi and so served in the tabernacle as a priest. He became jealous of the position and authority given to Moses and Aaron by God.
  * He conspired with Dathan and Abiram to get the people of Israel to rebel against their God-given leaders.
